# Refees 
## A subscription-based model to hedge Gas Fees on the Ethereum Blockchain
----

### Abstract

Large gas prices and volatility are the cause of multiple problems on the Ethereum Mainnet. 
Several solutions such as Layer 2 or Gas Token were proposed over the last few years to deal with them. 
However, on the Mainnet, traffic keeps increasing and gas fees problems are far from being solved. 

To this end, we propose, ReFees, a scheme to harness the speculative power of gas fee volatility to a party, while at the same time
offering insurance guarantees to another.
